                    On the adge of a beautiful forest lived three little pigs.
                    Once they wanted to leave home.
                    They hadn't walked far when the first little pig grew tired.
                    He quickly built a house from straw.

                    It wasn't long before the second little pig stopped walking.
                    She built house from the sticks and branches.
                    The third little pig walked on, and on, and, finally, he found a perfect place.
                    He built a strong brick house.

                    Meanwhile, the hungry Big Bad Wolf came across the first house.
                    "Little pig, let me come in or I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down!"
                    "No!" cried the first little pig

                    So the Big Bad Wolf huffed and he puffed and tiny straw house came tumbling down!
                    The little pig ran as fast as he could until he arrived at the house of he's sister.

                    The Big Bad Wolf snuck up to the house.
                    "Little pigs, let me come in!" he growled.
                    "No!" cried the pigs.
                    So the Big Bad Wolf huffed and he puffed and the wobbly stick house came tumbling down!

                    The two little pigs run untill they reached the third pigs house.
                    "Don't worry, we are safe in my strong brick house".
                    The Wolf huffed and puffed but nothing happened.

                    The wolf climbed up onto the roof and jumped down the chimney!
                    He landed in a hot pot and burned his tail! So he ran away as quickly as he could.
                    And three little pigs lived happily ever after.
